# Python-for-data-analysis
This code is a collection of all the python projects I have ever done. Starting from 2017 until most recently, for a Data Analysis training program.
I started with how to work with simple variables, and worked on multiple example projects including some diverse libraries like pandas, tkinter, scikit-learn and Pytorch.
Currently I am playing around with some ML and DL libraries like fastai and looking into some openCV and NLP applications.
I find the transfer learning problems very interesting but they are also very time-demanding. 
I am interested in seeing how existing NLP solutions for English can be taken into some Indian languages and develop solutions on top. 
If you have similar ideas or solutions, please don't hesitate writing me!

Major learnings from:
Charles Russell Severance   - University of Michigan @ https://www.coursera.org/learn/python
data analysis projects from IBM learning - 
Most of the other code is part of some coursework I did.
